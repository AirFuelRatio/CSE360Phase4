The EffortLogger-V2 Directory is for when we combine all of our code, meaning we wont have 20 different java and FXML files, rather collecting Main class code into 
a Main java file (1 main(EffortLogger.java)) , Contoller code (1 for login scene, 1 for main scene), and FXML files  (loginpage.FXML and loggerPages.FXML)
